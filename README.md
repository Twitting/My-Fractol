## Fractol

> Desctiption
>
> In this project I've practiced in mathematics with complex numbers. This program 
> can display 3 different fractal sets, such as Mandelbrot set, Julia set and Tricorn set.
> Fractal sets are sets of points, given by iterated function, and increasing the number of
> iterations causes infinite fractal shapes.


### how to install:
